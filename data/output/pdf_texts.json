The PFS results align with those of the Scoping Study on the \nproject released to the ASX on November 9th 2023. \nThe PFS highlights the project's exceptionally strong economics and outlines a pathway for Lake Hope to \nbecome a global supplier of low-cost, low-carbon HPA, benefiting both the local Ngadju Aboriginal Native title \nholders and the broader community. The robust economics stem from the unique characteristics of the Lake \nHope deposit, which facilitate cost-effective mining and processing.  \nThe PFS confirms that, to the best of Impact's knowledge based on published data, the Lake Hope project \ncould be among the lowest-cost producers of HPA globally, potentially by a significant margin of at least 30%. \nGiven these strong fundamentals, Impact will issue 120 million shares, escrowed for 12 months, to exercise its \noption to acquire an 80% interest in Playa One Pty Ltd, which owns the Lake Hope assets and intellectual \nproperty, including two patents for metallurgical processes (ASX Release March 21st 2023). \nWork will now commence on a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS), which will include the construction of a pilot \nplant to produce HPA samples at scale for discussions on offtake agreements. The pilot plant project, currently \nunderway, will be part-funded by the recent federal government grant awarded to Impact Minerals in \ncollaboration with CPC Engineering and Edith Cowan University (ASX Release October 22nd 2024). \nIn addition, as part of these studies, Impact will focus on the potential integration of the Lake Hope ore and its \nassociated metallurgical processes with the assets and intellectual property related to the HiPurA process, \nwhich were recently acquired through Impact\u2019s 50% share in Alluminous Pty Ltd (ASX Release April 23rd 2025).  \nAs the acquisition occurred near the end of the PFS, the study only pertains to Lake Hope as a stand-alone \nproject and does not consider integration with HiPurA. Impact believes the HiPurA acquisition will accelerate \nthe Company\u2019s entry into the HPA market by several years, potentially enhancing the economics of the \ncombined projects.  \n \n \n \n"

    "text": " \n \n \n \nASX:IPT | ABN 52 119 062 261 \n        3 \n \nImpact Minerals\u2019 Managing Director, Dr Mike Jones, said, \u201cThe Lake Hope PFS clearly demonstrates that \nImpact Minerals is now on the cusp of delivering a significant, low-cost and highly scalable HPA project. In just \nover two short years since acquiring the rights to the project, we have proven that Lake Hope\u2019s unique natural \nfeedstock, combined with a straight-forward flowsheet, offers one of the most capital-efficient and \nenvironmentally responsible pathways to high-purity alumina production globally. The Project\u2019s strong \nmargins, minimal carbon footprint, and ability to deliver 4N product without critical reagents or complex \nprocessing provides us with a clear competitive advantage as the HPA market enters a phase of rapid growth.\u201d \n\u201cImportantly, the PFS positions Lake Hope to potentially be the upstream foundation of our vertically \nintegrated HPA business. Through our recent acquisition of a 50% interest in Alluminous Pty Ltd and the \nHiPurA\u00ae downstream processing technology we are now accelerating plans to seamlessly integrate Lake Hope \nfeedstock with HiPurA\u2019s potentially modular HPA production capacity. This unique model offers Impact the \nflexibility to scale production in line with market demand and customer qualification, while minimising capital \nintensity and de-risking the path to early revenues.\u201d \n\u201cWith the PFS now complete, our next steps are clear: we will advance the detailed engineering required to \nbring Lake Hope into production, which will revolve around our exciting federal government co-funded \nmembrane research project now underway in conjunction with Edith Cowan University and CPC Engineering. \nWe believe very significant improvements to our flow sheet will emerge from that work. We will also progress \napprovals and initiate off-take discussions. At the same time, we will help fund and rapidly develop the HiPurA\u00ae \nmodular production pathway to establish near-term capacity and position Impact as a differentiated, vertically \nintegrated supplier of high-purity alumina to the global market. The opportunities in front of us are significant \nand today marks a major milestone in what is shaping up to be an exciting future for Impact Minerals and our \nshareholders.\u201d \n \nSUMMARY OF THE PRE-FEASIBILITY STUDY \n \nProduction Base \n\u2022 Potential to become a major producer of HPA with stand-alone steady-state production of \n10,000 tonnes per annum following a two-year ramp-up. \n\u2022 Initial mine life of 33 years. \n\u2022 Conservative commodity price estimate of US$22,000 per tonne of HPA compared to recent \nforecasts of more than US$25,000 per tonne from 2026 onwards. \n\u2022 Ideally positioned to meet forecast growth in demand for HPA over the next decade. \n\u2022 For a stand-alone operation as per the PFS, Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) completion and FID \nfor a stand-alone operation are anticipated in H1 2028. \n\u2022 Integration studies with the HiPurA process and the potential for a modular scale-up in \nproduction to commence immediately, to accelerate to commercial production by several years \n(ASX Release April 25th 2025).   \n \nPhysical Parameters  \n\u2022 JORC Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of 2.8 million tonnes at 25.1% Al2O3 for 700,000 tonnes of \ncontained Al2O3 (alumina) (ASX Release November 19th, 2024). \n\u2022 Maiden JORC Proved and Probable Ore Reserve of 1.7 million tonnes at 26% Al2O3 for 450,000 \ntonnes of contained Al2O3, a resource to reserve conversion rate of 66%. \n \n \n \n \n"

The Project is expected to ultimately create a robust supply \nchain from a mining and refinery operation to produce 10,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of 4N HPA material for \nthe global market. \nThe Lake Hope Project's PFS financial assessment, which includes a maiden JORC 2012 Ore Reserve Proved and \nProbable Ore reserve estimate of 1.73 Mt at 26.0% Al2O3, clearly demonstrates the project's economic robustness. It \nhas an estimated NPV10 of AUD $1,165m and an IRR of 47.5%. This financial assessment is based on real, \nfinanced, and post-tax analysis. \nThe PFS report indicates that the mine is estimated to exploit approximately 64,500 wet metric tonnes per \nannum (wmtpa), or approximately 54,300 dry metric tonnes per annum (dmtpa), of run-of-mine (\u201cROM\u201d) \nalunite-bearing evaporite ore over a total mine life of 33 years. It is proposed that the mine will only operate \nduring the summer months when the lake surface is completely dry, and not necessarily every year. The \nevaporite will be stockpiled on-site at Lake Hope and then transported to Kwinana for final refinement. At \nnameplate capacity, a nominal 10,000 tpa of 4N HPA will be produced at the proposed Kwinana refinery. \nThe report consolidates several studies conducted over the previous year to assess the viability of the Project at \na PFS level. Strategic Metallurgy Pty Ltd was commissioned to develop the METSIM model for the refinery based \non the testwork programmes managed by Impact Minerals Limited (\u201cImpact\u201d) and its consultants. TME Mine \nConsulting (\u201cTME\u201d) was commissioned to build on the mining study conducted during the Scoping Study by \nobtaining quotations from selected mining contractors and hauliers. Additionally, CPC Engineering Pty Ltd was \ncommissioned to engineer the refinery to enable CapEx and OpEx cost estimates to be quantified at a Class 4 \nAACE level of maturity (+/-25%). \nThe study also outlines Impact\u2019s plans to develop a pilot plant to test additional opportunities and presents \nrecommendations to progress to the DFS Phase. \nWestern Australia is a highly developed resource and investment jurisdiction with a long-standing tradition of \nmineral extraction and processing. The area has an established, well-educated workforce and efficient logistics \nthroughout the mineral value chain. The project includes additional upside scenarios, such as the potential to \nextend operations to other salt lakes currently under exploration licences in Playa One Pty Ltd\u2019s (\u201cPlaya One\u201d) \nportfolio.  \nImpact has now elected to exercise its option to purchase 80% of Playa One Pty Ltd, the owner of the Lake Hope \nproject and associated intellectual property, including two patents for metallurgical processing.  \n \n \n"

It is centred on two small salt lakes situated about 20 km south of \nthe Norseman-Hyden Road (Figure 1) at GDA94/MGA Zone 51, 239944m east, 6410410m north. The \nlakes are called West Lake and East Lake and are part of the greater Lake Hope drainage system. An \naccess track extends from the road to the lakes from the Norseman-Hyden road and is currently used for \nexploration and sampling purposes. A new access road will be constructed for the project and has been \nincluded in the capital cost estimate.  \n \n1.5.2 Mining Site Location \n \nFigure 2. Location of the Lake Hope HPA Project. \n \nImpact is applying for a mining concession and an environmental permit under the Code of \nEnvironmental Compliance, which includes the mining and processing of evaporite from West Lake. A \nsubsequent application for East Lake will be required.  \nWest Lake and East Lake are two of the evaporite deposits within the Playa One holdings, located \napproximately 20 km south of the Hyden\u2013Norseman road. Once extracted, the evaporite will be \nstockpiled to facilitate regular haulage of ROM to the Kwinana-based refinery. The chemically benign solid \nwaste from the refinery will be backhauled to the mine site, stockpiled, and backfilled during the mining \noperations. Liquid waste, primarily dilute acid waste, will be treated before management through \nrecycling or off-site discharge in Kwinana.  \nA proposed pilot plant will use new membrane technology to minimise acid waste, provided through the \n$2.87 million grant from the Federal Government's Cooperative Research Centres Projects (CRC-P: ASX \nRelease October 22nd 2024). \nThe pilot plant, to be designed and managed by CPC Engineering and built at Edith Cowan University \n(ECU), will validate and optimize Impact\u2019s flowsheet while integrating Edith Cowan University's \nMembrane Selective Technology (MST) to maximise reagent and water recovery and minimise waste. \n"

Preliminary \ndewatering and the establishment of haul roads around the proposed mining panels will be required \nbefore the commencement of each mining campaign. \nA single excavator and several dump trucks will work on the lake surface, utilising top-loading techniques, \nwith mining excavations retreating along defined panels to a common haul road before moving to the \nnext adjacent panel. Gradual panel extraction will create a mine void that will be partially backfilled with \nprocess waste over time, while the remainder will fill with water and naturally rehabilitate. \nThe evaporite will be stockpiled on a Rom pad adjacent to West Lake and transported to Kwinana in side-\ntipping B Double road trains throughout the year. Solid refinery waste will be backhauled and stockpiled \nnext to the ROM stockpile and then backfilled into the mine voids during each mining campaign. \n1.5.4 Refinery \nThe proposed refinery location in the Kwinana industrial area provides access to essential infrastructure, \nincluding Hydrochloric (HCl) acid, water, power, and gas. Additionally, it offers a readily available source \nof skilled process operators and maintenance contractors. \nPreliminary discussions with DevelopmentWA confirm that the site is available for lease and \ndevelopment. The refinery layout will ensure easy access to all equipment for operational and \nmaintenance needs while maintaining a compact footprint to minimise construction and ongoing costs \n(Figure 3). \nThe final product will be packaged into bags and sent on pallets or in containers to the customer. \n \nFigure 3.

The Mallee Bioclimatic Zone features a mix of medium woodland, mallee heath, \nscattered tallerack, scrub heath, and samphire grasses in the fringing dunes surrounding the lake. \n \n1.6.1 Environmental Studies \nBiota Environmental Sciences has completed a desktop study, followed by a flora and vegetation survey \nof the lake area, its immediate surroundings, and the proposed access road. No State or Federally listed \nThreatened Ecological Communities (TEC) or Priority Ecological Communities (PEC) were recorded within \nthe survey area. Furthermore, no species listed as Threatened under the Commonwealth Environment \nProtection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 or the State Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 were \nfound in the survey area, despite thorough searches of potential habitat. Several priority species were \nnoted during the survey. \nBiota also conducted a basic and targeted fauna survey, as defined in Environmental Protection Authority \n(EPA) guidance. Five broad fauna habitats were identified within the survey area, with open woodlands \ncomposed of Eucalyptus species and Callitris forming the dominant habitat type. Furthermore, none of \nthe recorded fauna habitats represented TEC or PEC habitats within the survey area.  \nThe desktop study identified a total of 283 species of vertebrate fauna previously recorded within the \nstudy area, of which 23 were considered significant species. During the field survey, 58 species of \nvertebrate fauna were observed, including 14 terrestrial mammal species, seven bat species, 35 bird \nspecies, and nine reptile species. Only three significant vertebrate fauna species were recorded from the \nsurvey area: Malleefowl, nominated as Vulnerable; the Western Brush Wallaby, designated as a Priority 4 \nspecies; and a Central Long-eared Bat, classified as a Priority 3 species. \nIn addition, eleven species of significance were considered \u2018likely to occur\u2019 or \u2018may occur\u2019 within the \nsurvey area based on previous regional records and field assessments of the habitats present. The survey \narea is situated beyond the eastern edge of Carnaby\u2019s Black Cockatoo distribution, with the closest known \nbreeding tree records being approximately 50 kilometres west, near Forrestania. Within the surveyed \narea, 60 Wheatbelt Wandoo were identified as potential black cockatoo habitat trees, ten of which \ncontained hollows potentially suitable for breeding. However, the species was not recorded from the \nsurvey area, and no evidence of foraging or breeding activity was noted. Given this, and that the survey \narea is approximately 50 kilometres beyond the documented range of the species, it is considered \nunlikely that Carnaby\u2019s Black Cockatoos inhabit the area. \nFurther environmental surveys will be required over the proposed infrastructure and access roads as well \nas seasonal surveys and these will be completed as part of the DFS. \n1.6.2 Native Title  \nA heritage survey, which comprised both an archaeological field survey and ethnographic consultation \nwith authoritative knowledge holders from the Ngadju Native Title Party, was completed was completed \nover both West Lake and East Lake in 2023 (ASX Release July 27th 2023)  \nThe survey area was assessed as having no Aboriginal artefacts or cultural heritage concerns, which \nground-disturbing activities would impact. The survey provides evidence that, subject to negotiating a \nmining agreement with the Ngadju Native Title holders, there are no obvious impediments to mining on \nthe lakes.  \nInitial discussions held with the Ngadju body corporate have been encouraging and further consultation \nwill occur as the project progresses.  \n"

Mining campaigns will occur annually for the first three \nyears before shifting to every three years, delivering ore to the ROM stockpile for continuous haulage to the \nKwinana-based refinery until mineral inventories are fully depleted. \nAll material mined from the lake deposit is sent to the ROM stockpile for eventual processing, making targeted \nexcavation depths and mine planning execution important components of successful ore recovery from the lakes \nwhich will be assisted by onsite grade control processes, mine survey, and high precision GPS systems installed \non the mining excavator. Average excavation depths are between 0.75m and 1.25m for both lakes with a \nmaximum target dig depth of 1.5m in West Lake. \nMining areas target grades above 25% Al2O3 from both West Lake and East Lake (Figure 4) to complement the \nprocess flowsheet and design criteria to produce 10,000 tonnes per annum of HPA product. The Life of Mine \n(LOM) schedule contains a total mineral inventory of 1.79 Mt at 25.9% Al2O3, supporting a total process life of \n33 years across 13 mining campaigns. \nThe mineral inventory includes a subset Ore Reserve estimate of 1.73 Mt at 26% Al2O3, with Inferred mineral \nresources and unclassified dilution materials comprising only 4% of the total inventory. \n \n \nFigure 4. Target Mining Areas (gold) and mineralisation boundaries (red). \nThe first three mining campaigns occur annually to allow for a gradual increase in mining activities and the \nbuilding of ROM stockpiles to support the two-year break between the subsequent three-yearly mining \ncampaigns, while minimising start-up operational risks. The final campaign is necessary only to accommodate \nthe last backfill of Process Waste material backhauled to the site.  \n"

Mining \nareas are delineated by main (or trunk) haul roads built on top of the Lake surface using material sourced from \nborrow pits along the site access road. Individual mining panels within each mining area are 25 m in width, with \nareas under main haul roads (HR panels) typically 50 m in width. \nMining sequences have been generally constrained to one mining area at a time with HR panels not able to be \nmined until adjacent mining areas had been completed, ongoing access is no longer required, and haul road fill is \nremoved from the surface. \nThe highest-grade mining areas have been given sequence priority with the final mine area designs generally \ndictating much of the mining sequence logic.

Production scheduling \nconcentrated on maximising the overall NPV for the project, ensuring steady plant feed tonnages and grades. \nThe mine design strategy targeting >25% Al2O3, extraction sequencing and scheduling results have been \nvalidated by the pit optimisation results which supports a higher grade focus as the best economic outcome for \nthe deposit given the current process design and flowsheet. \nA formal mining contractor Request for Quotation (RFQ) to provide the relevant mining costs was successfully \ncompleted, with mine establishment costs, fixed costs, dewatering, excavation, backfill, and haulage costs \ndeveloped from the responses.  \n \n1.8.1 Mining Waste, Ore Loss and Dilution \nGiven the nature of the deposit, no conventional waste material is generated during the mining sequence \ngiven all material within the mine designs is bulk mined to target depths and sent to the ROM stockpile for \nhaulage to the Process Plant, inclusive of all classified resources and unclassified materials. \nWaste, in the form of dilution, is included within the mineral inventory. Distal waste is the main \ncontributor to dilution within planned designs (i.e. base of mineralisation, lake surface and mineralisation \nextremities). The mineral inventory contains a total of 1.2% dilution. \nOre loss was calculated within the mine schedule optimisation software based on estimates of excavation \nedge loss over time (i.e. bench edge slumping to 15 degrees during mining breaks) and surface loss \n(0.25m) from primary haul roads being removed from the lake surface when required for ore mining \nunderneath. Total ore loss from the mine schedule is 1.4%. \n1.8.2 Infrastructure and Logistics \nLimited infrastructure exists in the immediate vicinity of the proposed mine. The site establishment team \nwill initially use the existing access track to reach the site and set up a basic camp. However, this will \neventually be replaced by an all-weather access road for mine site establishment, mobilisation, and road \ntransportation. \nThe approximately 16 km access road will be constructed as an all-weather road and, for the purposes of \nthe PFS, has not been bituminised. Development costs have been provided by a local contractor who \nvisited the site.  \n \nThe following assumptions have been made in developing the schedule and cost to build the access road, \nnone of which are considered problematic: \n\u2022 \nAccess to several water bores within 2 km of the proposed road; \n\u2022 \nSuitable borrow pit material is available locally. Four 30,000 t borrow pits are proposed, and \n\u2022 \nFour culverts have been assumed; the final design will dictate the actual number.  \nThe road access team will either base themselves at the proposed temporary accommodation at the mine \nsite or utilise the IGO Cosmos accommodation, which is available for use and is about a 40-minute drive \n"

The Scoping Study was based on the Playa One sulphate process \nwhich is quite different (ASX Release February 19th 2024). \nThe LTL process is essentially a two-stage hydrometallurgical procedure. Stage 1 involves pre-treating the ore \nwith potassium hydroxide at less than 90\u00b0c. This method removes potassium and sulphur from the ore, \nproducing a potentially high-value by-product of liquid sulphate of potash (SOP) along with a solid residue that \nadvances to Stage 2, where it is leached in hydrochloric acid at the same temperature of 90\u00b0c. The pregnant \nliquor solution (PLS) then undergoes two phases of crystallisation of aluminium chloro-hexahydrate (ACH) by \nincreasing and decreasing the pH. The ACH is subsequently calcined to yield HPA. \nStage 2 of the process is an established method of production of HPA and is used commercially by two private \nCanadian producers of HPA (Polar Performance Materials and Advanced Energy Materials) and is offered under \nlicence by Lava Blue, a Queensland based specialist in high-purity materials.  \nThe flow diagram in Figure 8 details the process route for producing a 4N HPA product, as well as a potential \nSulphate of Potash (\u201cSOP\u201d) by-product.  \nAside from the construction materials, most equipment is conventional and well understood; however, certain \npieces of equipment are regarded as specialised and will require additional vendor testing during the later study \nand piloting stages. \nMultiple vendors provide centrifuges, which are well established in hydrometallurgical mineral processing. \nHowever, they become somewhat specialised when considering the temperatures involved and the limits \nplaced on construction materials for the highly corrosive environment. \nCalcination will be highly specialised, particularly in the initial stage where the chloride is gassed off, resulting in \nan extremely aggressive corrosive environment. The vendor engaged for the PFS has invested significant time \nand resources in developing the necessary materials and design technology, which includes some piloting but \nhas limited commercial application at this time. \nMultiple vendors provide membrane purification technology solutions under low temperature and/or low \nacidity/alkalinity conditions. The specific duty of HCl purification will be a limiting factor; this has been discussed \nwith potential vendors and considered in the process design conducted to date. This aspect of the process \nflowsheet will be a focus of the pilot plant development. \nThe SOP crystallisation is a commercially established process for which vendor packages for the whole process \nmay be available. While this may limit the options in terms of supply, it will, however, decrease the risk of \ndesigning a bespoke process. \nWhile 4N HPA has been produced during the test work programmes, no SOP has been generated for detailed \nanalysis in the test work to date but is scheduled to be included during the pilot plant stage. \n"

Indicative schedule \n1.14 Marketing \nThe HPA market is experiencing strong demand growth driven by several key downstream applications, \nincluding: \n\u2022 \nLED Applications: HPA remains crucial in LED manufacturing as a sapphire substrate material and \nphosphor component. While this represents a mature market segment, the emergence of micro-LED \ntechnology is expected to drive additional future demand. \n\u2022 \nSemiconductor Industry: The increasing sophistication of semiconductor manufacturing is creating new \ndemand for HPA, particularly for artificial intelligence, quantum computing, robotics, electric vehicles \nand Internet of Things applications.  \n\u2022 \nLithium-ion Batteries: Growing demand for electric vehicles and battery energy storage systems is \ndriving significant HPA consumption in ceramic-coated battery separator and electrode coatings. HPA \nenhances battery safety, decreases anode and cathode degradation reactions, and increases cell \nlifetime. This sector represents one of the fastest-growing demand segments. \n\u2022 \nSapphire glass: used in a wide variety of applications including watch and smart device coverings and \noptics. \n\u2022 \nAdvanced Ceramics: The increasing use of biomedical implants, specialized electronics, lasers and \nindustrial components is driving steady demand growth in this sector. \nIn addition to the existing applications, additional future end-use applications where HPA will demonstrate \nsignificant value in use are expected to be identified. \n \n1.14.1 Global Supply and Demand of HPA \nResearch conducted by Grand View Research valued the 2024 HPA market at US$4.63 billion and expects \nthe market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 23%, resulting in a US$15.8 billion industry by \n2030. The key demand industries cited for driving this growth include electric vehicles, light-emitting \ndiodes, and semiconductors. \nCalendar Year\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nDesign and build \nMicro Plant\nOperate\nMicro Plant\nDesign and build \nPilot Plant\nOperate\nPilot Plant\nEnvironmental Baselines\nNative Title\nPermits\nDFS\nFID\nMobilisation\nEngineering\nConstruction\nCommissioning\nRamp up Commercial plant\n5k \n8k \n10k \n2031\n2032\n2033\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n"

During the DFS stage, IPT will explore \nopportunities to create higher purity 4N5+ and 5N products through the pilot plant, which will enhance \nthe economics of the Definitive Feasibility Study. \nImpact will pursue a 12-month stockpile programme to evaluate the seasonal effects of weather on \nstockpile integrity, surface runoff, and ore slumping. This should involve transport simulations to analyse \nthe risks of material buildup and discharge safety via side tipper trucking. \nOutput from the pilot facility may produce findings that offer significant positive benefits to the larger \ncommercial refinery design. These may be associated with plant operability, process optimisation, acid \nrecovery and waste acid management, and construction materials, specifically the calciner, through \npiloting this section of the pilot plant with a potential vendor. \nThe project should conduct all necessary in-house and vendor supply process tests to ensure that the \nprocess flowsheet is not overdesigned and that anticipated design parameters are met or exceeded. If \nreductions in the process design can be achieved, this may lead to significant reductions in the size, cost, \nand delivery of the vendor equipment. \nThe current energy balance is preliminary in nature, and the potential for energy recovery has not been \nincorporated into the design. In addition, the project\u2019s energy supply includes gas for calcining, \ndistillation, evaporation, and crystallisation. The use of electricity as an alternate heat source should be \nassessed in the DFS. By 2030, the percentage of renewable power within Synergy\u2019s electrical energy mix \nis expected to provide significant ESG benefits as well as potential OpEx benefits. \n \n \n"

The majority of these will be covered during the pilot test work. \n \n1.17.1 Geology Modelling \nFuture work on mineralogy and geology of the playa systems in the Lake Hope resource area should \ninclude the following: \n \n\u2022 Mineralogical Estimation: A robust mineralogical estimation system based on metallurgical \ntesting and mineralogical reconciliation exercises. The objective is to convert interpolated block-\nwide element concentrations into the respective mineral modalities. This will aid in determining \nany potential phases that may accommodate refractory alumina. \n\u2022 Mineral Distributions: Investigate whether the estimated modalities of minerals \u2013 especially \naluminous phases \u2013 exhibit any form of spatial heterogeneity. If any mineral hosts of refractory \nalumina have been identified, a mineral modality model of Lake Hope will enhance optimisation \nand mine scheduling. \n\u2022 Hydrology: Using the lake-morphology model above, perform a more thorough analysis of lake \nhydrology. Ultimately, this will provide estimates of seasonal and annual ingoing and outgoing \nwater flux which will inform dewatering studies for mining. \nFuture Exploration Potential: The combined understanding of lake morphology, the processes that shape \nthem, and their influence on mineral distributions will yield an informed model for targeting mineral \nsystems that may be used to uncover other playa lakes prospective for alumina. \n \n1.17.2 Mining  \nIt is recommended that the following activities are undertaken during and/or leading up to the DFS: \n\u2022 Conduct a detailed groundwater and hydrological study to enhance the understanding of the \ngroundwater model, assess potential water volumes, and more accurately quantify the \ndewatering management requirements for mining operations. \n\u2022 Include a comprehensive range of options to manage both groundwater inflows and surface \nwater runoff from the pit, along with the necessary approvals to permit the various \nmanagement options available. \n\u2022 Consider expanding the mining and miscellaneous tenure to encompass East Lake and nearby \nareas, including minor satellite lakes, to ensure mining tenure over the East Lake deposit is \navailable in time for mining. This will also support ancillary mining activities that may involve \nborrow material sourcing and pit water management requirements. \n\u2022 Conduct a comprehensive geotechnical study of the mine, focusing on lake bearing capacities \nand trafficability under various conditions, including evaluations of available borrow fill material \nfor Trunk haul road construction requirements. \n\u2022 Conduct further test pit exercises on site to enhance understanding of the behaviour of \nexcavated mining areas during and after digging, including material handling characteristics, \nstockpile designs, and stockpile performance over time. \n\u2022 Review and optimise the mined quantities according to a minimum stockpile balance \nrequirement, which should be established from a comprehensive assessment of the overall \nROM pad and the design and construction methodology of the ROM ore stockpile. \n"

This will \nbe consolidated and optimised through further test work and simulations in the pilot plant and \nsubsequent DFS. The following areas will be pursued: \n\u2022 The KOH leach testwork will fine-tune the dosage and quantify the response to variations in ore. \nTemperature and pulp density are minor parameters but should be examined in more detail. \nThe optimum dose will be applied where the alunite decomposition is found to maximise or \nplateau. \n\u2022 Ore variability test work will be conducted to determine the effects of ore grade on the \nprocess's performance, particularly concerning recovery and reagent consumption or bleeds. \nBulk ore samples will also be collected to assess the physical properties relevant to the design \nand sizing of the materials handling section.  \n\u2022 The PFS HCl leach testwork has established that temperature is the most important variable, \nwith HCl strength being secondary; the trade-offs and optimisation will need to be better \nunderstood. The upper temperature may be limited by HCl volatility, but there is confidence in \napproaching the target temperature of 90\u00b0C. The HCl strength may or may not be important \nand will interact with the performance of the HCl recovery circuit \u2013 these responses need to be \nidentified. \n\u2022 The HCl recovery relies on established proprietary membrane technology to maximise the \nelimination of impurities in the waste acid stream, coupled with two-stage distillation to \nfacilitate the reconcentration of the acid before recycling. The testing is likely to involve \nconfirmatory testing by the vendor based on liquors from the test work or on an appropriate \nsynthetic liquor to mitigate the challenges of shipping actual acidic liquors.  \n\u2022 The process development in the pilot plant will review the opportunity to increase the recovery \nof HCl through advances in membrane technology, thereby reducing the percentage of HCl in \nthe waste acid stream. Test work on the waste acid stream from the pilot plant can be \nconducted, along with simulations for neutralising and treating this stream, in order to recycle it \nback into the process or discharge it through the Sepia Depression Ocean Outlet Landline \n(SDOOL) or a similar wastewater scheme.  \n\u2022 ACH precipitation will be evaluated in greater detail to examine the trade-offs between the \nnumber of stages and reagent recovery to robustly achieve 4N or better quality.

The MMT technique is an advanced airborne geophysical method that measures resistivity \nand conductivity to depths of approximately 1 km, depending on the subsurface geology. Impact\u2019s survey was \none of the first conducted in Australia. \nThe regional data suggest that Caligula is situated at the centre of an elliptical magnetic \u201ceye\u201d feature, coinciding \nwith a high gravity (Figure 3). These features are interpreted as folded mafic-ultramafic intrusions and resemble \nthe magnetic \u201ceye\u201d features and associated gravity highs that characterise Nova-Bollinger.   \nIn detail, the new target area was identified as a conductive anomaly in the MMT data that coincided with a \ndecrease in magnetic intensity within a linear magnetic unit on the eastern side of the Caligula anomaly (Figures 3 \nand 4). This change in geophysical characteristics was interpreted as possibly relating to the sulphide replacement \nof magnetite and, therefore, potentially linked to mineralisation. In addition, an airborne EM anomaly was \nidentified within the same zone. \nAccordingly, an infill soil geochemistry survey was conducted over the area at a sample spacing of 100 m by 50 m. \n \n \nFigure 3.

Two deep drill holes are planned to test the MMT and EM \nanomalies that underline the strong soil geochemistry (Figure 6). \nFurther target generation is ongoing, and these may also be incorporated into the drill programme. \n \n3. BROKEN HILL (IPT 100%)  \n \nDuring the Quarter Impact announced the acquisition of a large, 675 sq km landholding adjacent to its \ncurrent land position surrounding one of the world\u2019s greatest mines containing over 350 million tonnes of \nmassive sulphide mineralisation, the Broken Hill silver-lead-zinc deposit in New South Wales.  \n \nThe acquisition builds on exploration and research completed as part of the BHP Xplor program, in which \nImpact participated in its inaugural year, and positions the company as one of the largest ground holders in \nthe region, particularly to the south of Broken Hill. Impact now has 100% ownership of tenements covering \n1,770 sq km and over 100 kilometres of strike (Figures 7 and 8; ASX Releases January 17, 2023, and \nFebruary 16, 2023). \n \nThe Broken Hill region is currently experiencing a resurgence of interest in exploration. Broken Hill Mines \n(ASX: BHM, formerly Coolabah Metals Limited) recently purchased the privately owned Rasp Mine in \nBroken Hill and the nearby Pinnacles deposit. In addition, South32 Limited has entered a joint venture with \na private company that owns a significant ground holding north of the Broken Hill mine. This interest is \npartly driven by a recent increase in silver prices and long-term demand trends for zinc and lead. \n \nTERMS OF THE AGREEMENT WITH NEW FRONTIER METALS LTD \n \n1. Impact has completed an agreement and purchased from New Frontier Metals Ltd (ASX:NFM) its \nwholly owned subsidiary BHA No. 1 Pty Ltd (\u201cBHA\u201d), which holds the Broken Hill East Project \ncomprising tenements EL8434 and EL8435. \n2. Under the terms of the agreement, in consideration for NFM transferring all of the shares in BHA to \nImpact, NFM received $275,000 worth of IPT shares (based on a 14-day VWAP as at March 7th 2025), \nwhich IPT shares are subject to voluntary escrow arrangements for up to 6 months. \n3. Completion of the agreement, and the sale of BHA, occurred on Monday, 10 March 2025. \n \nThe Search for Copper at Broken Hill \n \nSince the discovery of the giant Broken Hill deposit in 1883, most previous exploration has focused on \nsilver-lead-zinc mineralisation. However, various styles of copper mineralisation are also known to occur \nthroughout the region and have been the focus of some exploration and shallow drilling, though with \nlimited success (Figures 1 and 2). Since copper mineralisation is commonly associated with, but peripheral \nto, numerous silver-lead-zinc deposits, many exploration geologists have asked, \u201cWhere is the large copper \ndeposit at Broken Hill?\u201d. \n"

A detailed interpretation of this \ndata has resulted in the identification of numerous target areas for large copper deposits. \n \nImpact became interested in the region's copper potential during exploration for silver-lead-zinc at the \nDora East prospect, located about 30 km south of Broken Hill (Figures 7 and 8).

    "text": " \n13 | P a g e  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA S X  A N N O U N C E M E N T  \n \n \n \nThe Crawford model proposed that there was an important, if not dominant, contribution of silver, lead, \nand zinc, along with associated pathfinder elements such as manganese and phosphorus, to the metal \nbudget at the Broken Hill deposit from a series of mafic gabbro sills that occur only at or below the Broken \nHill mineralisation (Figure 10).   \n \nFigure 10. Cross section through the Dora East Prospect showing high grade silver-lead-zinc and                           \ncopper-silver-zinc intercepts. \n \nCrawford\u2019s work indicated that the parental magma for the mafic gabbro sills was unusually iron-rich and \nalso that as those magmas fractionated (cooled) and crystallised, they would concentrate any silver-lead-\nzinc and other metals that could be released into the hydrothermal system that created Broken Hill.  \nImpact found field evidence at Dora East that supported this model.  \n \nA corollary of the proposed process is that the parental mafic magma would also have carried a large \namount of copper, which, if concentrated deeper in the system, could potentially form a very large \nmagmatic copper sulphide deposit. Alternatively, the copper may have accumulated as a large sedimentary \ncopper deposit, depending on how and when the copper was concentrated and released into the rock \nsequence. \n \nImpact\u2019s Xplor Work \n \nImpact completed to following research work funded by the Xplor program: \n \n1. Mapping and sampling of the mafic gabbro sills with a total of 655 rock chip samples taken across 99 \ndifferent mafic sills from throughout the Broken Hill stratigraphy (rock sequence). These were \nsubmitted for multi-element geochemical assay focusing on copper, lead, zinc and iron. \n \n2. A detailed magnetic interpretation of the south Broken Hill area. \n3. Geophysical case studies over the Dora East silver-lead-zinc discovery using the Sub-Audio Magnetic \n(SAM) and Audio-Magnetotelluric (AMT) techniques, together with some regional MT readings. \nBroken Hill-style massive sulphide mineralisation is generally non-conductive in traditional \nelectromagnetic (EM) surveys. The SAM and AMT techniques offer potential direct detection of \ngalena-sphalerite mineralisation. \n"

To clarify though, Impact is under no \nobligation to BHP with respect to the Broken Hill project. \n \nFigure 11 summarises the rock chip geochemistry results for copper, lead, zinc and iron (further details are \nprovided in the JORC Table at the end of this report). There are some clear relationships.  \n \nFigure 11. Summary of 655 rock chip samples taken across 99 gabbro units throughout the Broken Hill stratigraphic \nsequence. There are three major rock Groups (Basement, Thackeringa Group and Broken Hill Group), within which \nthere are 10 separate rock formations, all of which contain gabbro sills. The Broken Hill mineralisation occurs at the \ntop of the sequence at and above the Freyers unit (Figure 10). \n \nFirst, the gabbros become very iron-enriched towards the top of the sequence.  \n \nSecondly, the gabbros also become significantly more zinc and lead-enriched toward the top of the \nsequence. This supports the Crawford model in that the gabbro sequence is fractionating (or evolving) over \ntime and concentrating iron, lead and zinc (and other key metals not shown). Thus, these gabbros could \nhave provided metals (as well as heat and fluids) into the Broken Hill mineralising system. \n \nThirdly, and most importantly, as predicted, it is evident that copper is being depleted at the top of the \nsystem.  This suggests that copper may have been lost from the system over time; therefore, it is possible \nthat this copper has concentrated deeper in the sequence below the Broken Hill deposit.  \n \nImpact interprets the rock chip data, along with field evidence, to indicate the Crawford model could apply \nto Broken Hill and that there is significant potential for a larger copper deposit in the region.   \n \nTogether with the other data collected as part of the Xplor program, as well as in-house knowledge of the \nregion built up over the past ten years, several key areas have been identified as prospective for significant \ncopper mineralisation related either to magmatic sulphides or sedimentary sulphides. One such area is a \nlarge sub-basin identified in the magnetic data adjacent to the Farmcote Shear Zone in the newly acquired \nground (Figures 7 and 8). \n \n \n"

Leachwell is an assay technique that can digest gold from larger samples. As confirmed \nin the recent drilling, the gold systems at Popeye, Pritchard\u2019s, Two Peaks and Lead Mine are nuggety in nature with a \nsingle meter sample at Pritchard\u2019s returning results from 0.2g/t Au to 34.5g/t Au.

Numerous historical \nworkings along the Mangaroon Shear Zone have only seen limited, shallow drilling along ~200m of strike near the \nStar of Mangaroon mine. This area also contains the ~12km x 6km Bordah and ~50km long High Range prospects \nwhere limited previous exploration has identified outcropping gold and base metal mineralisation.  \n \nSelf-Funded Explorer Strategy \n\u2022 Dreadnought\u2019s strategy is to transform into a self-funded explorer. This involves a high-grade open pit at the Star \nof Mangaroon where funding, development, haulage & processing are outsourced to third parties. This is a \ncommon model in WA given the robust gold price. Once successful, extend this model to Popeye, Two Peaks, \nLead Gold Mine, Pritchard Well, etc. In this way, there is reduced reliance on market funding and internal \ncashflows are aimed at making life-changing discoveries. \n \nConsolidation Provides for First Ever Modern Exploration  \n\u2022 All historical workings and known gold occurrences relate to outcropping mineralisation. There has been minimal \nhistorical and modern exploration due to fractured, small-scale ownership with Dreadnought now undertaking \nmodern exploration for the first time. \n \nSignificant, Step-change, Growth Potential \n\u2022 Five historical mines developed on outcropping mineralisation and dozens of gold occurrences along highly \nprospective structural corridors. \n\u2022 Dreadnought is deploying modern geochemical and geophysical techniques to explore for mineralisation under \nshallow cover. These techniques have already generated new prospects with stronger and larger signatures than \nthe historical mines, including the region\u2019s largest high-grade producer at the Star of Mangaroon mine.  \n\u2022 Project-wide stream sediment sampling and geophysical surveys have identified additional camp scale prospects \nat Bordah and High Range. \n \nShallow, High-grade Gold  \n\u2022 The initial Resource at Star of Mangaroon contains shallow, high-grade gold as per Table 1 below:  \nTable 1: Resource (2g/t Au cut-off grade) - Numbers may not add up due to rounding. \nType \nIndicated \nInferred \nTotal  \nTonnes \nAu (g/t) \nAu (Oz) \nTonnes \nAu (g/t) \nAu (Oz) \nTonnes \nAu (g/t) \nAu (Oz) \nTransition \n1,900 \n26.9 \n1,700 \n- \n- \n- \n1,900 \n26.9 \n1,700 \nFresh \n42,500 \n13.0 \n17,800 \n12,200 \n9.8 \n3,900 \n54,700 \n12.3 \n21,700 \nTotal \n44,400 \n13.6 \n19,500 \n12,200 \n9.8 \n3,900 \n56,600 \n12.8 \n23,400 \n \n\u2022 Also, Popeye, located <1km from the Star of Mangaroon, contains significant shallow high-grade gold including: \nPOPRC001: 3m @ 22.8 g/t Au from 13m  POPRC002: 1m @ 1.6 g/t Au, 15.5g/t Ag from 11m \n \nExceptional Metallurgical Recoveries \n\u2022 The region is known for its free gold. Accordingly, metallurgical work at Star of Mangaroon produced exceptional \nrecoveries from standard gravity and carbon in leach circuits averaging 96.7% combined recovery including an \naverage 74.4% gravity recovery (ASX 14 Oct 2024). \n \n \n"

This drilling aimed to extend and determine the orientation of the mineralised lode.  \n\u2022 Drilling then moved to Pritchard\u2019s (8 holes, 544m), Two Peaks (3 holes, 180m) and the Lead Mine (11 holes, \n546m) with holes designed to test bed rock mineralisation beneath historical hard rock and alluvial workings. \n\u2022 Assays are expected in May/June 2025 with follow up RC and diamond drilling to commence in June 2025.  \nDreadnought Resources Ltd (\u201cDreadnought\u201d) is pleased to announce the completion of \ndrilling at the 100% owned Mangaroon Gold Project (\u201cMangaroon\u201d), in the Gascoyne region \nof WA. \nDreadnought\u2019s Managing Director, Dean Tuck, commented: \u201cWe are pleased with the first drill program of 2025 being \ndelivered on time, on budget and with encouraging observations of mineralised lodes at all prospects. We look forward to drill \nresults being received later this month in May and potentially into June 2025. In the meantime, we are focused on planning \nand preparation of our next round of drilling at Mangaroon which will not only include follow up drilling on the mining leases \nbut our first discovery focused drilling at Steve\u2019s Reward and Inevitable. This program is the first of several that will occur in \n2025 as we deliver our Finding More Gold, Faster Strategy.\u201d \n \n \nFigure 1: Photo of the Topdrill RC rig drilling at the Lead Mine with the High Range prospect in the background. \n"

The shaft uncovered a quartz lode running about 1oz tonne. There is no record of additional \nwork or drilling at Popeye. Being located on the same mining lease as the Star of Mangaroon, Popeye is a priority \ntarget to add near term production ounces.  \nMineralisation at Popeye appears to be related to a strongly altered north-south shear zone adjacent to a north-\nsouth trending dolerite dyke which appears to have experienced brittle offset in several locations along the shear \nzone. Gold mineralisation is associated with quartz-sulphide veining including copper, lead and bismuth minerals. First \npass drilling by Dreadnought produced significant intercepts of: \nPOPRC001: 3m @ 22.8 g/t Au from 13m  \nPOPRC002: 1m @ 1.6 g/t Au, 15.5g/t Ag from 11m \nGiven the relative location of the mineralised intercepts, two interpretations were made based on observations from \nmapping around Mangaroon. These are either a shallow dipping main lode with wing veins, or multiple lodes.  \nDreadnought recently drilled 12 RC holes (900m) to test these interpretations and to extend and determine the \norientation of the mineralised lode in relation to the major structures, dolerite contact and lithological boundaries.  \nSeveral holes intersected the targeted mineralised quartz-sulphide veins including within and at the contact with the \ndolerite dyke.

At the bottom of the shallow \ncreek, a series of NNW trending quartz, gold and base metal lodes were identified and worked to a shallow depth. \nA total of ~2,000oz has been produced from Pritchard\u2019s.  \nThe mineralised veins are hosted within quartz-feldspathic gneiss and sericite altered granitoid. Free gold in the lodes \nis described as being most strongly associated with galena, a lead sulphide mineral.  \nPreviously 7 RC holes were drilled at Pritchard\u2019s with the best result being 3m @10g/t Au from 65m (PRWRC2). All \ndrilling was in the same orientation including hole PW002 which attempted to twin PRWRC2 retuning no significant \nresults. It is now interpreted by Dreadnought, that the gold lodes lie in a different orientation. \nDreadnought recently drilled 8 RC holes (544m) to test this interpretation. Drilling consisted of 4 fence lines of 2 \nholes each covering ~300m of strike. \nAll holes were drilled towards the southwest and intersected one or more zones of quartz sulfide veining with \nelevated lead. These results support Dreadnought\u2019s interpretation. Assays are expected in May/June 2025. \n \nFigure 5: Plan view image showing the location of recent drilling (blue dots) in relation to the interpreted lode horizon and \nprevious drilling. \n \n"

Historical records from Two Peaks are incomplete \nwith at least ~1,000oz of production from 1986-1993 confirmed. Unverified historical reports have an additional \n~5,000ozs @ 7.9g/t Au produced in 1981-1982.  \nTwo Peaks consists of two shallow pits roughly 10-20m wide that run for over 130m in a NNE orientation. \nMineralisation has been described as either a zone of NNW trending sheeted quartz stockworks (WAMEX Report A82353) \nor east to southeast trending en-echelon arranged sigmoidal veins (WAMEX Report A79994). \nAll accounts agree that the mineralisation is hosted within massive granitoid with free gold in the lodes described as \nbeing strongly associated with lead/copper minerals and limonite. \nIn 2016, 27 shallow RC holes (800m) were drilled to test the western extension of interpreted EW striking, steeply \ndipping mineralised veins with a best result of 1m @ 3.1g/t Au from 36m (TPC020) (WAMEX Report A112527). It is now \ninterpreted by Dreadnought that this drilling was too shallow and not oriented to intersect the mineralised lode. \nDreadnought recently drilled 3 RC holes (180m) over to test the interpretation that mineralisation is striking north-\nnortheast and plunging to the west-northwest.

Between \n1956-1960 the mine produced ~11.4t of concentrate containing 8.3t of lead, 94oz of silver and 49oz of gold.  \nThe Lead Mine consists of two small open pits developed either side of a NNE trending and steeply east dipping \ndolerite dyke. At the base of the western pit, is an east-west underground drive leading to a vertical shaft extending \nto surface. \nMineralisation at the Lead Mine is described as being hosted in a series of stacked north-south striking and shallow \neast dipping quartz veins with lead/copper minerals and free gold. The flat lying veins cross-cut a steeply dipping west-\nnorthwest trending shear zone with complex stockwork veining within an altered felsic intrusion orthogneiss. The \nvertical structures and veins, where they intersect the flat lying veins, appear to be the target of the underground \nworkings.   \nDreadnought recently drilled 11 RC holes (546m) to test:  \n- strike extensions of the flat lying lodes either side of the dolerite dyke; \n- the shear zone and associated steeply dipping west-northwest structures; and \n- north and south of the open pits, testing both sides of the dolerite dyke.  \nZones of quartz-sulphide veining with elevated lead/copper anomalism were identified in most holes.  \nAssays are expected in May/June 2025. \n \nFigure 7: Plan view image showing the location of recent drilling (blue dots) in relation to the historical workings and previous \ndrilling. \n \n \n \n"

Numerous historical \nworkings along the Mangaroon Shear Zone have only seen limited, shallow drilling along ~200m of strike near the \nStar of Mangaroon mine. This area also contains the ~12km x 6km Bordah and ~50km long High Range prospects \nwhere limited previous exploration has identified outcropping gold and base metal mineralisation.  \n \nSelf-Funded Explorer Strategy \n\u2022 Dreadnought\u2019s strategy is to transform into a self-funded explorer. This involves a high-grade open pit at the Star \nof Mangaroon where funding, development, haulage & processing are outsourced to third parties. This is a \ncommon model in WA given the robust gold price. Once successful, extend this model to Popeye, Pritchard\u2019s, \nTwo Peaks, the Lead Mine etc. In this way, there is reduced reliance on market funding and internal cashflows are \naimed at making life-changing discoveries. \n \nConsolidation Provides for First Ever Modern Exploration  \n\u2022 All historical workings and known gold occurrences relate to outcropping mineralisation. There has been minimal \nhistorical and modern exploration due to fractured, small-scale ownership with Dreadnought now undertaking \nmodern exploration for the first time. \n \nSignificant, Step-change, Growth Potential \n\u2022 The area contains 5 historical mines developed on outcropping mineralisation and dozens of gold occurrences \nalong highly prospective structural corridors. \n\u2022 Dreadnought is deploying modern geochemical and geophysical techniques to explore for mineralisation under \nshallow cover. These techniques have already generated new prospects with stronger and larger signatures than \nthe historical mines, including the region\u2019s largest high-grade producer at the Star of Mangaroon mine.  \n\u2022 Project-wide stream sediment sampling and geophysical surveys have identified additional camp scale prospects \nat Bordah and High Range. \n \nShallow, High-grade Gold  \n\u2022 The initial Resource at Star of Mangaroon contains shallow, high-grade gold as per Table 1 below:  \nTable 1: Resource (2g/t Au cut-off grade) - Numbers may not add up due to rounding. \nType \nIndicated \nInferred \nTotal  \nTonnes \nAu (g/t) \nAu (Oz) \nTonnes \nAu (g/t) \nAu (Oz) \nTonnes \nAu (g/t) \nAu (Oz) \nTransition \n1,900 \n26.9 \n1,700 \n- \n- \n- \n1,900 \n26.9 \n1,700 \nFresh \n42,500 \n13.0 \n17,800 \n12,200 \n9.8 \n3,900 \n54,700 \n12.3 \n21,700 \nTotal \n44,400 \n13.6 \n19,500 \n12,200 \n9.8 \n3,900 \n56,600 \n12.8 \n23,400 \n \n\u2022 Also, Popeye, located <1km from the Star of Mangaroon, contains significant shallow high-grade gold including: \nPOPRC001: 3m @ 22.8 g/t Au from 13m  POPRC002: 1m @ 1.6 g/t Au, 15.5g/t Ag from 11m \n \nExceptional Metallurgical Recoveries \n\u2022 The region is known for its free gold. Accordingly, metallurgical work at Star of Mangaroon produced exceptional \nrecoveries from standard gravity and carbon in leach circuits averaging 96.7% combined recovery including an \naverage 74.4% gravity recovery (ASX 14 Oct 2024). \n \n \n"

These examples should \nnot be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. \n\u2022 \nInclude reference to measures taken to ensure sample \nrepresentivity and the appropriate calibration of any \nmeasurement tools or systems used. \n\u2022 \nAspects of the determination of mineralisation that are \nMaterial to the Public Report. \n\u2022 \nIn cases where \u2018industry standard\u2019 work has been done this \nwould be relatively simple (e.g. \u2018reverse circulation drilling \nwas used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was \npulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay\u2019). In other \ncases more explanation may be required, such as where \nthere is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. \nUnusual commodities or mineralisation types (e.g. \nsubmarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed \ninformation. \nReverse Circulation (RC) and Diamond (DD) drilling was \nundertaken to produce samples for assaying.  \nRC Drilling \nTwo sampling techniques were utilised for the RC drilling, 1m \nmetre splits directly from the rig sampling system for each \nmetre and 3m composite sampling from spoil piles. Samples \nsubmitted to the laboratory were determined by the site \ngeologist. \n1m Splits \nFrom every metre drilled a 2-3kg sample (split) was sub-\nsampled into a calico bag via a Metzke cone splitter from each \nmetre of drilling. \n3m Composites \nAll remaining spoil from the sampling system was collected in \nbuckets from the sampling system and neatly deposited in \nrows adjacent to the rig. An aluminium scoop was used to \nthen sub-sample each spoil pile to create a 2-3kg 3m \ncomposite sample in a calico bag. \nA pXRF is used on site to help determine mineralised samples. \nMineralised intervals have the 1m split collected, while \nunmineralised samples have 3m composites collected. \nDiamond Core \nCore is orientated for structural and geotechnical logging \nwhere possible. In orientated core, half core is submitted to \nthe lab for analysis in intervals ranging from 20cm to 1m \ndepending on the geological context. If core is orientated, \nthen the half core is cut so as to preserve the orientation line \nwith the same side of the core submitted down the hole. \nAll samples are submitted to ALS Laboratories in Perth for \ndetermination of gold by PhotonAssay from crushed sample \n(ALS Method Au-PA01). \nSelect samples are also submitted for 48 multi-elements via 4 \nacid digestion with MS/ICP finish (ALS Code ME-MS61) to \nassist with lithological interpretation.  \nQAQC samples consisting of duplicates, blanks and CRM\u2019s \n(OREAS Standards) are inserted through the program at a \nrate of 1:50 samples.  \nHistorical Drilling \nMA1-28 (Balde Exploration 1988: A24641):  \nEvery metre a ~2kg sample (split) was subsampled into a \nplastic bag via a two-tier riffle splitter. A metre was logged \n"

The gold sector is strong with the current spot price above $5,000/oz. At then \nindicative forward prices of ~$4,600oz an Operating Cashflow of ~$50M. This reflects an Operating \nCashflow change of ~$1.9M for each $100 of gold price movement.  \nThis lays the foundation for the Company to transform into a self-funded explorer by: \n\u2022 \nOutsourcing the funding, development, haulage & processing of the high-grade open pit at the Star of \nMangaroon to generate a positive cash flow. \n\u2022 \nGrowing the Resource by adding shallow, near-term production ounces through extending the Star \nof Mangaroon and adding Popeye, located on the same mining lease. \n\u2022 \nExtending this model to Two Peaks, Lead Gold Mine and Pritchard Well to reduce reliance on market \nfunding through internal cash flows. \n\u2022 \nDeploying funds to high-ranking greenfield exploration targets to enable making a significant \ndiscovery. \n \nFigure 1 Long Section from Popeye through the Star of Mangaroon showing the location of historic and  \nrecent drilling highlighting the significant intercepts that are outside the current Resource and scoping study. \nDrilling was conducted at Star of Mangaroon and Popeye in early April 2025 (ASX: 3 Apr 2025) and was \nfollowed by drilling at Pritchard\u2019s, Two Peaks and the Lead Gold Mine.
